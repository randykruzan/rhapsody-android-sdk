# Rhapsody Android SDK

## Introduction
The Rhapsody Android SDK was designed to provide a very easy way to integrate streaming music into your Android application. The SDK itself handles playback and is used in conjunction with the [Rhapsody Developer API](http://developer.rhapsody.com) to give your users access to over 18 million tracks. The SDK plays full-length tracks for authenticated Rhapsody subscribers.

We have provided here the SDK (rhapsodysdk.jar) and a sample application which provides examples you can use to build your own app with Rhapsody streaming music.
